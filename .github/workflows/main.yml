jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Check out our repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so our job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Set up node.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:

      # Set up Python 3.
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
